#### It's a big deal to start *coding from scratch*
<br>
 However, *everything can be reached* with a _plan_, having _dreams and goals_.
<br>

1. Use official [open-sources] (https://dart.dev/guides "Dart guide") for studying
2. Downloaded anything you need to work
3. Keep calm and practice!

#### I pushed this file.md using GIT Bash

```
git add README.md && git commit -m "New DEMO README file" && git push

```
